We provide a small number of sample data in sample.xlsx.
There are 5 columns:
	ID: the id for each sample
	Source: the sample source. It can be the url where the sentence can be found from PubMed. If the source is 'MIMIC', then it is a sample matched from the MIMIC-III (we did not provide a full version due to the dataset restriction). If it is 'Written', then it means the sample is written by our annotators. 
	medical term: the true medical term.
	abbreviation: the abbreviation of that medical term.
	sentence: the actual sample sentence. Note that the abbreviations are surrounded by special star chars (for example, ***** C&S *****)
