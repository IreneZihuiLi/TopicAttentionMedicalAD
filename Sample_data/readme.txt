We provide a small number of sample data in sample.xlsx.
There are 5 columns:
	ID: the id for each sample
	Source: the sample source. It can be the url where the sentence can be found from PubMed. If it is 'Written', then it means the sample is written by our annotators. We did not include MIMIC-III samples due to the policies.	
	medical term: the true medical term.
	abbreviation: the abbreviation of that medical term.
	sentence: the actual sample sentence. Note that the abbreviations are surrounded by special star chars (for example, ***** C&S *****)
